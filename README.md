### Stereo Vision & 3D Reconstruction Project

This repository is a deep dive into the world of stereo vision and 3D reconstruction using two primary methodologies: Two-View Stereo and Plane-Sweep Stereo. The project focuses on converting 2D images into vivid 3D scenes, bridging the gap between flat imagery and spatial perception.

**Key Highlights**:
- **Two-View Stereo Reconstruction**: A detailed implementation of the rectification process, disparity-to-depth transformation, and visualization of 3D point clouds constructed from two views.
- **Plane-Sweep Stereo Reconstruction**: Explores the concept of warping multiple views to a reference view across depth planes, culminating in the creation of an immersive 3D volume and its subsequent conversion to a point cloud.
- **Visualization & Analysis**: Advanced visualizations using the K3D library, offering a comparative lens between two-view and plane-sweep reconstructions.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: A step-by-step guide answering core project questions, paired with mathematical derivations, screenshots, and insights.

The techniques and skills refined throughout this project find relevance in various domains such as computer vision, robotics, and augmented reality. Dive in to witness the transformation of 2D imagery into tangible 3D worlds!
